# Regression-Machine-learning-Projects

**Machine Learning Regression Models**

This repository showcases foundational and advanced projects on machine learning regression using various techniques implemented with the scikit-learn library.

**Projects Overview**
**Project 1**: Boston House Price Prediction
**File**: Boston_Housing_Price_ML.ipynb
This is an advanced version of the Boston house price prediction project. The notebook applies a more sophisticated framework where data is processed through multiple models for training, testing, prediction, and evaluation.
**Techniques Used**:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor
The objective is to predict the median value of homes based on features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers.


**Project 2**: Advertising Sales Prediction
**File**: Advertising_Sales_ML.ipynb
This project builds on the techniques learned in the Boston housing project. A regression framework is implemented to predict advertising sales based on numerical and categorical attributes (e.g., TV, radio, and newspaper advertising methods).
**Techniques Used**:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor


**Project 3**: Big Mart Sales Data Analysis
**File**: Big_Mart_Sales_ML.ipynb
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales data for Big Mart outlets based on attributes such as product type, outlet type, visibility, and more. A robust regression framework is implemented to handle both numerical and categorical variables for effective prediction.
**Techniques Used**:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor

The objective is to predict the sales of products across different outlets while accounting for factors like product visibility, outlet size, and location type.
Each project represents a step forward in my learning journey, incorporating progressively advanced methods to build robust and interpretable regression models. The repository is a reflection of how theoretical understanding evolved into practical applications in solving real-world problems.
